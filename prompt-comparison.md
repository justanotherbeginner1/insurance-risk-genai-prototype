# Prompt Comparison and Evaluation

## Objective

Evaluate how changes in system instructions, model parameters,
and model selection affect output quality.

---

## Experiments Conducted

### Instruction Changes
More detailed system instructions resulted in more actionable
and structured responses.

### Temperature Tuning
- Low temperature: focused, deterministic output
- High temperature: more speculative and less precise

### Model Comparison
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: fast, general responses
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: deeper reasoning and guideline-based justification

---

## Key Insight

Prompt quality depends on both instruction clarity
and selecting the appropriate model for task complexity.
