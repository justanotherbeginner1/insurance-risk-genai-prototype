# Insurance Risk Summary – GenAI Prototype

A Generative AI prototype using Vertex AI Studio and Gemini, focused on
prompt engineering for insurance risk analysis and multimodal workflows.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how Generative AI can be applied to real-world
insurance workflows using prompt engineering rather than model training.

The prototype explores how an AI assistant can:
- Summarize unstructured insurance data
- Extract structured claim information
- Identify underwriting risk factors
- Analyze images and perform reasoning
- Be deployed rapidly as a working web app

All work was done using Vertex AI Studio and Gemini models.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository focuses on **prompt design and reasoning**, not infrastructure.

Included:
- Role-based system prompts
- Zero-shot and few-shot prompt examples
- Structured data extraction prompts
- Prompt comparison and parameter tuning insights
- Multimodal (image + text) prompt design
- Notes on media generation and responsible AI

Excluded intentionally:
- Cloud credentials
- Project-specific configuration
- Auto-generated deployment code

## Tech Stack

- Vertex AI Studio
- Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Prompt Engineering
- Multimodal Generative AI
- Cloud Run (via Vertex AI Studio deployment)

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Designing precise system instructions
- Improving output accuracy using few-shot prompting
- Controlling model behavior with temperature and Top-P
- Comparing models for speed vs reasoning depth
- Applying GenAI to professional, domain-specific use cases

This repository represents hands-on learning and experimentation with
Generative AI workflows rather than a production-ready system.
